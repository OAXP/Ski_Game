# Ski_Game
This is a Ski game made for a college evaluation (Completed in 1h30/4h).
The music was not requested in the evaluation I just added it as a bonus to make the game fun to play and because I finished the project too early.

Music used (BONUS) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6wRHQu9BgM

## How to play
When you press play, you can use the left and right arrow keys or A and D to move left or right.
You have to collect the most amount of points that you can collect.
If you hit a tree, you die and you can restart or leave the game.
